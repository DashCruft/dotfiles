## Requirements (You need most of these)
- **[Picom](https://github.com/jonaburg/picom) (Jonaburg Version)** <br>
- **OpenRGB** for RGB control (you can remove the line in the bspwm file but I use it for myself so)<br>
- **[sxhkd](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/sxhkd/)** for keybinding.<br>
- **[Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)** for the top bar.<br>
- Download **[this](https://github.com/DashCruft/dotfiles/blob/main/Font_Awesome_6_Pro_Regular.ttf)** font and install it or the icons won't appear or will be missing from your polybar!!
